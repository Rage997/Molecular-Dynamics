# Molecular-Dynamics

A Molecular Dynamcis simulation using Lennard-Jones potential.
Verlet list has been implemented to have efficient short range molecular interactions. All the code relies on numpy.
# How to run
The parameters for the simulation can be setted in settings.py. The code can be executed by '''python3 main.py'''
